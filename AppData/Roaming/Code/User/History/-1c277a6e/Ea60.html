          <h2>The Striping System</h2>
          <p>Each student will earn stripes on their belt.  This will show them how their progress is going as well as help the instructor to know what they need to work on in order to be ready when the next grading comes.
            The one end of the belt will have colored stripes on it, and the other end will have black stripes.
            
            <br>The colored stripes represent the physical curriculum;
              <br>- Blue - basics (blocks, strikes, kicks, etc.)
              <br>- Yellow - self defense (each belt has three moves)
              <br>- Red - Routine Kata
              <br>- White - Bo routine Kata (this starts at the purple rank)
            
            <br> The black stripes are for the Character Word Of The Month.  Each month we have a new word that we cover. During class these words will be discussed as "Mat Chats" to try and help the students better understand each word and how they can incorporate it in their lives. 
            <br>The students are required to access an online form that will also talk about that months word and then ask a series of questions about the word.  Once they have submitted their answers they will earn a black stripe on their belt.
            <br>The Kinder Karate kids are welcome to submit these forms as well, but an instructor will test them verbally as well in case they miss filling the form out.
            <br> IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE TO GRADE EVERY STUDENT MUST HAVE 3 black stripes and all of their required colored stripes. If they have all of their stripes they will receive a grading card that will let you know the details of their upcoming grading.
