        </div>    
        <p>Each student will earn stripes on their belt.  This will show them how their progress is going as well as help the instructor to know what they need to work on in order to be ready when the next grading comes.
    The one end of the belt will have colored stripes on it, and the other end will have black stripes.

    The colored stripes represent the physical curriculum;
	- Blue - basics (blocks, strikes, kicks, etc.)
	- Yellow - self defense (each belt has three moves)
	- Red - Routine Kata
	- White - Bo routine Kata (this starts at the purple rank)

    <br> The black stripes are for the Character Word Of The Month.  Each month we have a new word that we cover. During class these words will be discussed as "Mat Chats" to try and help the students better understand each word and how they can incorporate it in their lives. 
    The students are required to access an online form that will also talk about that months word and then ask a series of questions about the word.  Once they have submitted their answers they will earn a black stripe on their belt.
    The Kinder Karate kids are welcome to submit these forms as well, but an instructor will test them verbally as well in case they miss filling the form out.
    <br> IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE TO GRADE EVERY STUDENT MUST HAVE 3 black stripes and all of their required colored stripes. If they have all of their stripes they will receive a grading card that will let you know the details of their upcoming grading.

        <p>Gradings take place 3 times per year. (April, August, and December).  Typically but not set in stone <br>they are on the third Saturday of these months.  <br>It is our goal that every student be ready to grade in these gradings.  <br> will also have a makeup grading the following month for anyone who will not available on the regular grading date.  <br>Again these will be held on the third Saturday of the month.  Anyone who cannot attend this date will <br>have to wait until the next regular grading date. (we do not do private gradings).</p>

        </div>
        <p>Sparring starts in stages to help the students get comfortable with the process easier.  At the rank of orange belt students have the option of attending these classes, but not required until purple.  When they start these classes they will be mainly doing drills designed to help them learn the basics (footwork, body position, and proper technique) and some basic combinations.  Once they have a grasp on that we will work on how to apply them with a partner.
        At all times the students will be reminded to respect each other and to work together.  
        The first lesson we learned in the martial arts was that kicking and punching without respect was being a bully, and we still feel very strongly about that.
        Sparring can be a lot of fun at the same time as they learn some very important things like distance control and body positioning in a self defense situation.
        In order to be able to attend a sparring class the student must have their own sparring gear.  Head gear, mouth guard, gloves (not MMA gloves) and foot protection are mandatory.  We sell sparring packages at a good price, but buying our gear is not mandatory if you can find a better deal somewhere else.  
        We will only guarantee sparring equipment that was sold by us though.</p>

            </div>
            <p>At Bishop Family Martial Arts we start weapons training at the rank of Orange (optional but required at Purple).  The white (bo) stripes begin at purple.  <br>Each student must have their own bo to attend class. <br>Each class has an attendance limit set to ensure that class size doesn't get too large and not be able to help each student.  Sometimes we will exceed this limit to accommodate the members.  The Bo class however will never exceed the number set.  This is strictly for safety reasons.  If the class is any larger it increases the chance for injury from another student.</p>

        </div>  
        <p>Every Student can attend a max of 3 classes per week.  Sign up is done through the zenplanner app and is mandatory. <br>This ensures class size is managable and all students recieve attention and proper instruction. <br>If the class is full there is a waitlist option. <br>If a student has signed up but does not show up this prevents another student from participating so please respect the process. <br>If the schedule prevents you from attending the neccessary classes please contact us and we will try to accomodate if possible. <br>Our utlimate goal is to help all our students become great martial artist and even greater members of society.</p>
